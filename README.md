# Smart-Garage



## Description
The Smart Garage project presents an intelligent solution for efficient car parking management. 

**Components:**
- **7-Segment Display:** Provides a real-time count of available parking spaces within the garage, enabling users to easily determine occupancy status.

- **IR Sensor:** Detects the presence of a car as it enters the garage, contributing to accurate occupancy tracking.

- **Servo Motor:** Connected to the gate, the servo motor opens and closes the gate automatically. It operates based on the availability of parking spaces.

- **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor):** Manages the garage lighting system. The system automatically adjusts the lighting based on ambient light conditions, ensuring optimal visibility.

- **Fire Alarm with Buzzer:** Enhances safety by incorporating a fire alarm system. In case of a fire emergency, a loud buzzer is activated to alert occupants.

**Functionality:**
1. **Parking Availability Display:**
   The 7-segment display constantly updates the number of available parking spots, helping drivers to quickly identify free spaces upon entering.

2. **Car Detection and Gate Control:**
   - The IR sensor detects the presence of a car approaching the garage.
   - If parking spots are available, the servo motor opens the gate, allowing the car to enter.
   - If no spaces are available, the gate remains closed.

3. **Lighting Control:**
   - The LDR assesses ambient light conditions.
   - The lighting system activates when the garage is dimly lit.
   - Lighting intensity is adjusted according to the detected light levels.

4. **Fire Safety:**
   - The fire alarm system, connected to a buzzer, ensures prompt alerting in case of a fire event.
   - The buzzer emits a loud, distinctive sound to draw attention to the emergency.


In conclusion, the Smart Garage project creates an intelligent parking system. This system offers efficient parking management, automated gate control, adaptive lighting, and heightened safety features for a modern and user-friendly garage experience.
